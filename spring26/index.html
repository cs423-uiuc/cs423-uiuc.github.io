    <h2>Course Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This course introduces students to the next step in operating system design
      (after CS 341 or equivalent).
      Students will understand the main operating system functions in class and
      analyze their implementation through a series of machine problems
      that require modifications to operating system code.
      Students will also be exposed to the concepts of virtual machines
      and issues of distribution such distributed files systems
      and map-reduce operators for distributed computation.
      The course will conclude with a series of advanced topics.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please contact the instructor if you have questions regarding the material or concerns about whether your background is suitable for the course.

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>
      The course will involve 5 machine problems, a midterm, and a final.
      Unless otherwise noted by the instructor, all work in this course is to be completed independently.
      If you are ever uncertain of how to complete an assignment,
       you can go to office hours or engage in high-level discussions
       about the problem with your classmates on the Piazza boards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grades will be assigned as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> <i>Machine Problems:</i>MPs will collectively account for 40-50% of the grade. Example: divided into 4%, 12%, 12%, 12%, and 10%. <b>All MPs should be solved individually.</b> <b>No late submissions are allowed.</b></li>
        <li> <i>Midterm:</i> The midterm will be worth 20% of your grade.</li>
        <li> <i>Final:</i> A final exam will be worth 20-30% of your grade.</li>
        <li> <i>Participation:</i> Accounts for 10%. Includes Piazza and in-class discussion.</li>
        <li> <i>4 Credit Section Only:</i> If you are registered for the four credit version of this course, you will be required to complete and 
		<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i824NZ22QsIMRU4-6lf8IFa1ghgmvgY-DsLf_IcPaxo/edit" target="_blank">summarize</a> weekly literature readings that are relevant to the subject matter being discussed in class. Satisfactory completion of these readings will be necessary to receive full credit in homework and participation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Expectations</h2>

    <p>
      The expectations for the course are that students will attend every class, do any readings assigned for class, and actively and constructively participate in class discussions. Class participation will be a measure of contributing to the discourse both in class, through discussion and questions, and outside of class through contributing and responding to the Piazza forum.
    </p>

    <p>
      Out of respect for your classmates, I ask that you turn off all screens: laptops, tablets, and phones for the duration of each class! Only exception: viewing or marking up lecture slides.
    </p>

    <p>
      More information about course requirements will be made available leading up to the start of classes
    </p>

    <h2>Ethics Statement</h2>

    <p>
      This course will include topics related computer security and privacy. As part of this investigation we may cover technologies whose abuse could infringe on the rights of others. As computer scientists, we rely on the ethical use of these technologies. Unethical use includes circumvention of an existing security or privacy mechanisms for any purpose, or the dissemination, promotion, or exploitation of vulnerabilities of these services. Any activity outside the letter or spirit of these guidelines will be reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from the class and possibly more severe academic and legal sanctions.
    </p>

    <h2>Academic Integrity Policy</h2>

    <p>
      The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Student Code should also be considered as a part of this syllabus.
      Students should pay particular attention to Article 1, Part 4: Academic Integrity.
      Read the Code at the following URL: <a class="paperlink" href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">http://studentcode.illinois.edu/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Academic dishonesty may result in a failing grade.
      Every student is expected to review and abide by the Academic Integrity Policy:
      <a class="paperlink" href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">http://studentcode.illinois.edu/</a>.
      Ignorance is not an excuse for any academic dishonesty.
      It is your responsibility to read this policy to avoid any misunderstanding.
      Do not hesitate to ask the instructor(s) if you are ever in doubt about what constitutes plagiarism,
      cheating, or any other breach of academic integrity.
    </p>

    <h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>

    <p>
      To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids,
      students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the as soon as possible.
      To insure that disability-related concerns are properly addressed from the beginning,
      students with disabilities who require assistance to participate in this class should

      and see the instructor as soon as possible.
      If you need accommodations for any sort of disability,
      please speak to me after class, or make an appointment to see me,
      or see me during my office hours. DRES provides students with academic accommodations,
      access, and support services.
      To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (V/TDD),
      or e-mail a message to <a href="mailto:disability@uiuc.edu">disability@uiuc.edu</a>.
